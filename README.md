# apod_wallpaper
A python script that retrieves the picture from the website https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html and sets it as a wallpaper.
 
__How to use App:__

I used pyinstaller to develop an executable for windows and macOs users that don't have python. Place the executable where you want, disable your antivirus, and execute. 
 



__How to use Script:__

To install python3 library; `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Execute "set_apod_wallpaper.py" with python3.
Additionally, beacause apod's website sometimes has a video instead of a picture, you can add an "alternative.jpg" in the same folder as "set_apod_wallpaper.py" which will be used if impossible to retrive astronomy picture of the day.
 
Script was written in Python3 and should work on most used Os, including macOs, windows, Linux: Cinnamon, Gnome, Mate...
